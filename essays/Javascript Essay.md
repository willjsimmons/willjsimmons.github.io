What do you think about Javascript so far?

In order to understand a programming language it is important to have a fundamental understanding of what the language was designed for and, more generaly understand what programming Languages are used for as a whole. In essence Languages are design to abstract away and allow developers to more simply instruct computers to perform a desired task. Given that there are many languages, Languages in many ways are analogous to the tools in the toolbox of a tradesman; you would not use a screwdriver for the job of a hammer. This being said, many developers tend to play favorites, and do elect to use their favorite tools for other than their intended purpose. It is no small secret that programming languages often fall in and out of favor with developers.This being said Javascript and by extension the newest version ES6 have continued to be popular amongst Website developers.

As mentioned above Languages have purpose. Thus it is possible to measure the quality of a language or an entire family of languages on certain metrics.
For example Javascript would be abismal for the purposes of low level systems programming for a nubmer of reasons. Firstly it is loosely typed, This is not what it was designed for.
As far as the fundamental metric, "Does Javascrapt allow "


learning curve.


An Athletic Approach:
    For the longest time common practice has been for educators, and even those that teach themselves a new skill to teach to the tool instead of the problem.
    Language learning like any skill should not be the goal in and of it self.




If youâ€™re a complete newbie, how does it compare to other programming languages that you know? If you have prior experience, did you learn new things from this module, perhaps with respect to ES6? Do you think Javascript is a good or bad programming language from a software engineering perspective?

What about athletic software engineering? Did you find the practice WODs to be useful? What do you think about this style of learning? Is it stressful? Is it enjoyable? Do you think it will work for you?

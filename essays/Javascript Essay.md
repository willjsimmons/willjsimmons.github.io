What do you think about Javascript so far?

In order to understand a programming language it is important to have a fundamental understanding of what the language was designed for and, more generaly understand what programming Languages are used for as a whole. In essence Languages are design to abstract away and allow developers to more simply instruct computers to perform a desired task. Given that there are many languages, Languages in many ways are analogous to the tools in the toolbox of a tradesman; you would not use a screwdriver for the job of a hammer. This being said, many developers tend to play favorites, and do elect to use their favorite tools for other than their intended purpose. It is no small secret that programming languages often fall in and out of favor with developers.This being said Javascript and by extension the newest version ES6 have continued to be popular amongst Website developers.

// what is javascript good for.

As mentioned above Languages have purpose. Thus it is possible to measure the quality of a language or an entire family of languages on certain metrics.
For example Javascript would be abismal for the purposes of low level systems programming for a nubmer of reasons. Firstly it is loosely typed, This is not what it was designed for.
As far as the fundamental metric, "Does Javascrapt allow "


learning curve.


### An Athletic Approach to Language Analysis:

For the longest time common practice has been for educators, and even those that teach themselves a new skill to teach to the tool instead of the problem.
Language learning like any skill should not be the goal in and of it self. Thus to be able to test your mastery of this or any language you must use it. 
One very effective approach is the athletic approach. This approach involves developing a set of problems specifically for testing your skills, in a significantly time constrained setting.
one idea when you first are learning is to pick a standard set of existing problems that can be solved using multiple languages. This way it is possible to compare the New tool to ones you are familiar with. 
Skill and Knowledge retention is greatly increased when the things you learn are easily related to things that are familiar. The time constraint also serves as a borrometer for your current level of understanding and can be use.
    
## Conclusion
It can thus be said that utility is subjective. While you may have a particular affinity for a hammer It is great to have favorite tools only when paired with a purpose it is your favorite for.Javascript is an excellent language particularly for the purpose it was designed for namely, adding interactivity to the web. Learning  a language such as Javascript using an Athletic Approach is a great way to compare languages for your self. the more tools in your own box the easier it is to use each one. It is not only important to know a language but to know when to use it is the first step on your path to software dev mastery. 




If youâ€™re a complete newbie, how does it compare to other programming languages that you know? If you have prior experience, did you learn new things from this module, perhaps with respect to ES6? Do you think Javascript is a good or bad programming language from a software engineering perspective?

What about athletic software engineering? Did you find the practice WODs to be useful? What do you think about this style of learning? Is it stressful? Is it enjoyable? Do you think it will work for you?

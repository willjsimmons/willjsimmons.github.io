# It starts with teamwork.

There are several indispensibal tenants to software engineering.
# Stronger code.

In earlier software engineering courses at the university of hawaii, students are exposed to the meteor , and meteor react framework. 
This being said the version of the framework that these earlier courses teach is not production grade.

# Larger Teams equate to more complexity.

Another complexity introduced in the course is that of team management. naturaly within any team people will take different roles and organize themselves

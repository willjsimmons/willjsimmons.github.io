# What makes a question good or bad
I remember as a young man asking my uncle what he called a rather Stupid question.
he quickly retorted with an example. He said "Now William a smart question is What are you eating? and a Stupid question is Why are you eating?". While in some contexts such as eating in a food free library or computer lab the second question makes sense  85% of the time this is not the case. Nevertheless I noded tacity and continued my breakfast, as his point was understood.
In essence It is very easy, and almost natural not to spend the extra brainpower to come up with good questions.
It is for this reason that up until recently internet support forums were full of stupid questions.
More commonly now however these less than helpfull questions are quickly discarded by both human and automatic forum moderators
Before they even take hold. This being said it is critical to be able to qualify and codefy the criteria that determine if a question is stupid or smart. One article that gives a high level overview and some concrete examples of general question quality controll best practices is "How to ask questions the smart way" an analysis based on this process is pretty thorough to weed out things that are less than helpfull.

## Help me help you and asked and answered
Good questions require you to have done your own research. Along this line of thinking it should be abundantly clear that No one likes a question that has already been answered several dozen times. One of the best ways to ensure that you do not run afoul of the mods is to ensure that you have already searched the very forum you are planning to post two to see if somenoe has already posted the same or a very similar question. It is very likely that someone else has already asked 
one example of a bad questions is this question here on stack exchange. (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/21865997/c-beginner-need-guidance). The linked Message follows the fundamental bad question format. I am new... why doesnt [insert code blob here] work.  In essence the question is not specific. the asker basically throws up their hands, and says I have written something and I don't know what it is or why it doesn't work. Although this clearly violates Raymonds rules in the before you ask, and many in the when you ask section
the community was gracious enough to answer however.

summary: Developed A Lamp based web Application for a Manufacturing Firm.
---
Developed and deployed a full-fledged Business Application, for inventory. I was responsible for creating a plan to develop and migrate an Excel-based business management system to the cloud.
Given that the business in question already had a foundational Excel table framework, it was simple to migrate. Lamp was selected as a platform due to the project size and given that the required business data is well structured.
Due to the nature of the business, and little need for expansion, a 6 table schema was developed to meet the businesses relatively uncomplicated needs.
Throughout this project, I not only successfully developed and deployed a robust Business Application but also honed my proficiency in various programming languages and software engineering best practices. This experience allowed me to gain a deeper understanding of the intricacies of cloud migration, database schema design, and the practical implementation of technology solutions to meet specific business needs.
Furthermore, by choosing the LAMP stack for this modest-sized project, I demonstrated my ability to make informed technology decisions that align with project requirements and business objectives.
As I continue to advance in my academic and professional journey, this project serves as a testament to my dedication to leveraging technology to streamline operations and enhance efficiency in real-world business scenarios.

On my 18th birthday, I registered my first Close Corporation NewLimaEnterprises Incorporated with the California secretary of state. Since then, I have founded several other business entities, and been responsible for opening corporations and Nonprofits for Family and friends. In addition to this, I have successfully applied for and received 501c3 status for two organizations and maintained corporate compliance for several corporations. My most recent entity endeavor was to found Optimum Resolve Inc. here in Hawaii. I am also responsible for the ongoing development and maintenance of the company site <a href="https://optimumresolve.com/">Optimum Resolve.com </a>. Optimum Resolve is a holding corporation for many subsidiary ventures which are currently under development. Including a Flight Club and a data management service. There is much to be expected of this organization in the coming years as this project is still under development.

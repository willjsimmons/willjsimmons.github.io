## Why it matters.

Aviation is a very unforgiving environment that requires incredible attention to detail, strong organizational skills, and an ability to multitask. While flying is challenging errors made in they air can result in deadly consequences. Software development is similar In that that there is often little room for error particularly for critical systems the costs are just as high.

## future plans

As mentioned above my intentions are to continue to pursue my instrument, and subsequently my cimmercial and multi engine ratings. Ultimately a career at the airlines is the end goal.

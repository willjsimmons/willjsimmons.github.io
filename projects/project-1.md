summary: My ongoing journey navigating the Pacific skies.
---
On September 3rd, 2019, I began my Aviation Journey with an introductory flight at Kalaeloa Airport not expecting much. Hundreds of hours later including the attainment of a Private Pilot License (PPL) and the pursuit of subsequent ratings. Through dedicated training and continuous learning, I have expanded my expertise in areas such as navigation, flight planning, and advanced flight maneuvers. I have initiated a YouTube channel that includes videos of what it is like to fly here in Hawaii. While the video blog aspect of my journey is not currently public, there are big plans to push this forward in the near future.  Throughout this journey, I have made many memories and made many friends. This ongoing project not only highlights my commitment to excellence in aviation but also serves as a platform for further expansion and reflection on my journey in the skies.

##Why it matters.

Aviation is a very unforgiving environment that requires incredible attention to detail, strong organizational skills, and an ability to multitask. While flying is challenging errors made in they air can result in deadly consequences. Software development is similar In that that there is often little room for error particularly for critical systems the costs are just as high.

## future plans

As mentioned above my intentions are to continue to pursue my instrument, and subsequently my cimmercial and multi engine ratings. Ultimately a career at the airlines is the end goal.

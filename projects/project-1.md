On september 3rd 2019 I began my Aviation Journey with an introductory flight at Kalaeloa. including the attainment of a Private Pilot License (PPL) and subsequent ratings. This project provides a comprehensive account of my aviation milestones, from the foundational PPL to additional certifications such as Instrument and Commercial ratings. Through dedicated training and continuous learning, I have expanded my expertise in areas such as navigation, flight planning, and advanced flight maneuvers. This ongoing project not only highlights my commitment to excellence in aviation but also serves as a platform for further expansion and reflection on my journey in the skies.

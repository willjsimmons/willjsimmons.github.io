---
On september 3rd 2019 I began my Aviation Journey with an introductory flight at Kalaeloa not expecting much. Hundreds of hours later including the attainment of a Private Pilot License (PPL) and the pursuit of subsequent ratings. Through dedicated training and continuous learning, I have expanded my expertise in areas such as navigation, flight planning, and advanced flight maneuvers. I have initiated a youtube channel that includes videos of what it is like to fly here in Hawaii. While the videoblog aspect of my journey is not currently public, there are big plans to push this forward in the near future.  Throughout this journey I have made many memories, and created many friends.This ongoing project not only highlights my commitment to excellence in aviation but also serves as a platform for further expansion and reflection on my journey in the skies.

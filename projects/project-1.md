summary: A wamp based personal accounting solution.
---

Accounting v2 represents my first dive into wamp based Full stack web development.
the backlog includes integration with microsoft outlook for bill reminders and other tools using microsoft graph restfull apis.
It is planned that this particular project will leverage javascript ajax for server and api communications. 
This softwear will also use the plaid api to import bank transactions in a quickbookesque manner.

The idea for this tool came about after using microsoft acces for personal bookeeping and financial management. 
It was found that while robust, access offered limited to no options for remotly accessing or updating the application.
In addition to this access as a general purpose database tool didn't offer the type of specialization needed for financial management.
It was thusly decided that implementation as a web app would provide the best route. 

other than third party apis this project is strictly my own and was fully developed by myself and has gone through several itterations and modifications of which we are currently on the third.

<p>In fall of 2023 as part of a Software engineering course, a group of four students and I decided to develop a program to help connect college students with easy to make and nutritious recipes.
We undertook this project in park to help develop our team skills and to learn and practice Agile and Issue-driven development. During the course of this project, all team members sharpened their mental tools
And improved their Source Control, Javascript, and Meteor skills. Given that this project was developed mainly in javascript our team opted for the name ES6-Enthusiasts (ES or ecmascript being a variant of javascript).
In the end our team met most of our goals, and maintained a copacetic, positive and effective environment.</p>
<h2 id="my-responsibilities">My Responsibilities</h2>

<p>For this project, I was responsible for about 25% of code additions to the main repository. A good portion of what I contributed, served as the core functioning code of the project, 
and was leveraged by my team-mates to create their own UI Components. Much of the structure and design related to Recipes, profile creation for our community section and authentication
fell under my controll.</p>

<h2 id="why-it-matters">Why it matters</h2>

<p>Developing team skills and learning the processes involved in working on complicated projects is essential. In addition to this, this project taught each of our team members how to be flexible, and to 
efficiently address unexpected setbacks. Finally, This project is intended to help serve our community. From an ethics standpoint, it is the duty of any software engineer that can help people, to attempt to help others.
While at semesters end, our project was not quite to the standard required for a full-fledged public facing application, the dream was there that some day this app may be of service to the collegiate community.</p>
<h2 id="future-plans">Future plans</h2>

<p>Although the project was very fruitful, due to life circumstances the team has no intention to support or maintain it. This being said, as of the time this post was written,
the actual project can be visited at the following link <a href="http://www.collegecuisineconnect.site">College Cuisine Connect</a>. Additional info about our team can also be found at <a href="http://www.collegecuisineconnect.site">ES6 Enthusiasts</a>,

On my 18th birthday I registered my first Close Corporation in California NewLimaEnterprises Incorporated. Since then I have founded several other business entities, and been responsible for opening corporations and Nonprofits for Family and friends. In addition to this I have succesfully applied for and received 501c3 status for two organizations, and Maintain corporate compliance for several corpoations . My most recent entity endeavor was to found Optimum Resolve Inc here in Hawaii. I am also responsible for the ongoing development and maintenance of the company site <a href="https://optimumresolve.com/">Optimum Resolve.com </a>. Optimum resolve is a holding corporation for many subsidiary ventures which are currently under development. Including a Flight Club and a data management service. There is much to be expected of this organization in the coming Years as this project is still under development.

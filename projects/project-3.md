On my 18th birthday I registered my first Close Corporation in California NewLimaEnterprises Incorporated. Since then I have founded several other business entities, and been responsible for opening corporations and Nonprofits for Family and friends. In addition to this I have succesfully applied for and received 501c3 status for two organizations, and Maintain corporate compliance for several corpoations . My most recent entity endeavor was to found Optimum Resolve Inc here in Hawaii. I am also responsible for the ongoing development and maintenance of the company site <a href="https://optimumresolve.com/">Optimum Resolve.com </a>. Optimum resolve is a holding corporation for many subsidiary ventures which are currently under development. Including a Flight Club and a data management service. There is much to be expected of this organization in the coming Years as this project is still under development.

## Why it matters

The ability to confidently plan and form an entity is extremely useful. But more than this it is very fulfilling to assist the people you love bring their nonprofit to fruition. It is an incredible asset to be able to navigate Paperwork with the efficiency of a parlegal.

## What is next

I plan to continue leveraging these skills, To form more organizations. And expand Optimum Resolve Inc., to include several subsidiaries.

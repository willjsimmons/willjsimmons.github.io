Game engine vl, Spring 2015. the project began as an experiment for exploring data compression and graphics card programming . 
Game Engine v2 is a work in progress project created to explore modern graphics and shader programing pipelines.

both of these projects allowed me to experiment with the concepts i have learned in ics 211.
the usage of huffman trees for compression and other coding schemes.
